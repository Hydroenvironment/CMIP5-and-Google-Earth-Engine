✅Useful javascript tools for downloading historical and projected climate data (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) from GCM`s in CMIP5 phase using Google Earth Engine

✅Extract with ease point data (coordinates) and using a polygon (asset).

✅Collection: NASA-NEX GDDP Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Climate Projections

✅Historical data is available from 1950 to 2005 and RCP 4.5-8.5 from 2006 to 2099.

✅More information, please check:https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NASA_NEX-GDDP
